# What's the MERN?
MERN stack is a software stack that includes four open-source technologies: (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). These components provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web sites and web applications.<br>
Among these technologies MongoDB is a database system, Node.js is a server-side runtime environment, Express.js is a web framework for Node.js and React is a client-side JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.<br>
Because all components of the MERN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MERN applications can be written in one programming language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.<br>

# Why I create this Organization Repository as a open-source project?
During my study journey, the open-source community has given me a bunch of resources and power. Not just MERN(MongoDB/ExpressJS/ReactJS/NodeJS) Stack(this kind of hard skill), but also including a lot of soft skills. Such as how to communicate with other people, and how to commit an issue with the templated description.<br>
So I wrote/forked/bought some code for this MEAN project, hoping could do a little bit of commitment to the open-source community.<br>
And after all, the best way of learning is doing, I'm pretty sure myself will benefit from this project as well.<br>

# How can you make a commitment here?
You are free to submit the PR to any repositories(of course, you need to fork it firstly). No matter is code or documentation. I'll appreciate your commitment and time.<br>

# Is there any recommended repo?
Em...No! Every repository is valuable to me. But you could pick any up according to your scenario.<br>
