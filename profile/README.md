# Why I create this Organization Repository as a open-source project?
During my study journey, the open-source community has given me a bunch of resources and power. Not just MERN(MongoDB/ExpressJS/ReactJS/NodeJS) Stack(this kind of hard skill), but also including a lot of soft skills. Such as how to communicate with other people, and how to commit an issue with the templated description.<br>
So I wrote/forked/bought some code for this MEAN project, hoping could do a little bit of commitment to the open-source community.<br>
And after all, the best way of learning is doing, I'm pretty sure myself will benefit from this project as well.<br>

# How can you make a commitment here?
You are free to submit the PR to any repositories. No matter is code or documentation. I'll appreciate your commitment and time.<br>

# Is there any recommended repo?
Em...No! Every repository is valuable to me. But you could pick any up according to your scenario.<br>
